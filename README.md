# FinisMaPhrase

Twitter bot that replies to messages with a complete phrase in French.

To see it in action, look here: https://twitter.com/FinisMaPhrase/with_replies

Based on [BelGTP2](https://huggingface.co/antoiloui/belgpt2) model (GPT-2 retrained for French) for text generation and [TF-Allocine](https://huggingface.co/tblard/tf-allocine) (based on CamemBERT itself based on BERT) for sentiment analysis.

## Process
* Take the provided prefix
* Generate a candidate sentence
* Check it with the sentiment analyzer to ensure it's positive
* If it's good, return it. Otherwise, generate a new candidate sentence (max of 20 iterations)
